📌 **42 School - Unix Process & Shell Project**  

## 📝 Description
**Minishell** is a **minimalistic shell** that mimics the behavior of **Bash**.  
It supports command execution, environment variables, redirections, pipes, and **additional enhancements beyond the mandatory requirements**.  
Developed as a **team project** with [Christophe Albor Pirame](https://github.com/CronopioSalvaje), we **extended** its functionality with unique features.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Bash-like prompt** with Git branch detection  
✅ **Supports standard shell operators** (`|`, `>`, `<`, `>>`, `<<`)  
✅ **Built-in commands** (`cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`)  
✅ **Handles environment variables (`$VAR`)**  
✅ **Executes scripts (`./minishell script.sh`)**  
✅ **Runs a second Minishell in the background for special commands**  
✅ **Signal handling (`Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-\`)**  

## 🏆 Result: **125% Score**
The project was successfully validated with a **125% score**, including bonus implementations. 🎉
